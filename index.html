                <p>SCP-002, also known as "The Living Room" resembles a tumorous, fleshy growth with a volume of roughly 60 m³ (or 2000 ft³). An iron valve hatch on one side leads to its interior,
                    which appears to be a standard low-rent apartment of modest size. One wall of the room possesses a single window,
                    though no such opening is visible from the exterior. The room contains furniture which, upon close examination,
                    appears to be sculpted bone, woven hair, and various other biological substances produced by the human body.
                        All matter tested thus far show independent or fragmented DNA sequences for each object in the room.</p>

                        with intricate circuitry and biological components. SCP-003 is capable of self-repair and has shown signs of life,
                        making it a unique and enigmatic entity. Interactions with SCP-003 are strictly controlled due to its potential threat,
                        and its true nature and origin remain largely unknown within the SCP Foundation lore.</p>

                <p>SCP-004, also known as "The 12 Rusty Keys and the Door", is a containment object within the SCP Foundation universe. 
                    It consists of a set of twelve rusted keys, labeled SCP-004-1 through SCP-004-12, and an anomalous door, designated SCP-004-EX. 
                    The keys are required to unlock the door, but the specific order in which they must be used remains unknown.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    SCP-004-EX is a massive, ornate door of unknown origin, constructed from an unidentified material. 
                    Attempts to breach or open the door without using the keys have been unsuccessful.
                    When the keys are used in the correct sequence, the door opens to reveal an unknown space or dimension, 
                    which varies each time the door is opened. Exploration teams sent through the door encounter diverse and 
                    often dangerous environments, and the door's unpredictable nature makes it a subject of ongoing research 
                    and containment efforts by the SCP Foundation.</p>

                    The key was discovered when a civilian used it to infiltrate a high security facility. SCP-005 seems to have the unique ability 
                    to open any and all forms of lock (See Appendix A), be they mechanical or digital, with relative ease. The origin of this ability
                    has yet to be determined.</p>

                <p>SCP-006, also known as "Fountain of Youth", is an anomalous substance within the SCP Foundation universe.
                    It appears as a clear, viscous liquid with potent regenerative properties. When applied to living organisms,
                    SCP-006 can significantly reverse the aging process, promoting rapid cellular regeneration and extending 
                    the subject's lifespan.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Despite its potential benefits, SCP-006 poses a considerable risk as it can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and mutations,
                    resulting in unpredictable and often hazardous outcomes. As a result, access to SCP-006 is strictly controlled, 
                    and experimentation with the substance requires authorization from the highest levels of the SCP Foundation. 
                    The true origin and nature of SCP-006 remain unknown.</p>
