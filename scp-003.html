                <h2>Special Containment Procedures:</h2>
                <p>SCP-003 is to be maintained at a constant temperature of no less than 35°C and ideally kept above 100°C. No living multicellular
                    organisms of Category IV or higher complexity may be allowed to come into contact with SCP-003.</p>
                <p>In event of total power failure, if SCP-003-1 begins to increase its mass, assigned personnel must engage in skin contact with
                    SCP-003-1. Ideally, personnel may use their body heat to return SCP-003-1 to above the critical temperature; however, 
                    skin contact must be maintained even in event of SCP-003 reaching activation temperature, lasting at minimum until SCP-003-1
                    advances fully to its second growth stage.</p>
                <p>Personnel who enter SCP-003's containment area must first be examined for body parasites of Category IV or higher complexity,
                    and sterilized if such organisms are present. All personnel who have come in physical contact with SCP-003-1 are to immediately
                    report for sterilization afterwards.</p>
                <p>SCP-003-1 must not be removed from SCP-003-2 except in case of emergency procedures detailed above. Any significant change in
                    SCP-003-2's rune activity (including pattern, frequency, or color) should be reported within three (3) hours of occurrence.
                    Cessation of rune activity must be reported immediately. SCP-003-2 must be supplied with power via the source designated
                    Generator 003-IX at all times.</p>

            <div class="description">
                <h2>Description:</h2>
                <p>SCP-003 consists of two related components of separate origin, referred to as SCP-003-1 and SCP-003-2.</p>
                <p>SCP-003-1 appears to be composed of chitin, hair, and nails of unknown biology, arranged in a configuration similar to that of
                    a computer motherboard. Testing reveals SCP-003-1 to predate earliest known circuit boards by a factor of thousands of years.
                    SCP-003-1 is considered sentient but not actively dangerous except under certain conditions.</p>
                <p>SCP-003-1 was found on a stone tablet, SCP-003-2, on which it currently resides. The runes on SCP-003-2 are not part of any known
                    language, and emit pale, flickering light patterns.</p>
            </div>
                
                
            <!-- Hidden content, revealed by button click -->
            <div id="hidden" style="display: none;">
                    <p>SCP-003-2 is controlled by a (non-biological) internal computer, the contents of which are mostly inaccessible without risk of
                        damaging SCP-003-2. SCP-003-2 is capable of controlled emissions of radiation, including heat, light, and anomalous radiation types.
                        SCP-003-2 contains an internal power source of an anomalous nature, which appears to have been losing power since several
                        centuries before discovery.</p>
                    <p>It is considered probable that SCP-003-2 was created for the purpose of containing SCP-003-1. Partially interpreted data recovered
                        from SCP-003-2 may refer to a past and/or potential future LK-class restructuring event caused by SCP-003-1.</p>
                    <p>SCP-003 was located by remote viewing team SRV-04 Beta. It appears possible that SRV-04 Beta was deliberately contacted by SCP-003-2.
                        Other organizations have also been alerted to SCP-003's existence, possibly by similar means. Despite this activity, 
                        SCP-003-2 does not appear to be sentient, based on its lack of reaction to M03-Gloria analysis and procedures.</p>
                    <p>When SCP-003 drops below the temperature of 35°C, both components react.</p>
                    <p>First, SCP-003-1 enters a growth state characterized by an exponential increase in mass. This growth state consists of two stages. 
                        In both stages, SCP-003-1 partially fuels its growth by converting matter around it, starting with any surrounding inorganic material, 
                        including atmospheric elements, then nonliving organic material, including cells of dead skin, hair, chitin, enamel, keratin,
                        and other biological materials.</p>
                    <p>The first stage is always the same. SCP-003-1 will first increase its mass, then take a form similar in shape to an ophiuroid
                        (brittle star) of fifteen meters in diameter (including what appears to be a central processor of three meters in diameter). 
                        It will form sensory organs that appear to scan its surrounding environment, and will partially convert the area around it to 
                        an unidentified anomalous substance (SCP-003-2 seems immune from conversion).</p>
                    <p>The second stage describes a growth alteration which occurs when SCP-003 comes into contact with living organic material; 
                        SCP-003 appears to "template" itself off of the organic material, and will attempt communication with organisms that match 
                        its initial "template" or "templates".</p>
                    <p>In its second stage, SCP-003-1 may pause, slow or change its growth, and will also convert inorganic and nonliving organic 
                        elements into functionally similar structures while anomalously altering their physical makeup.</p>
                    <p>While growth is consistent in the first stage, in the second stage SCP-003-1's growth rate is diminished by 20-90% so long as 
                        SCP-003-1 remains in contact with living organic material. The percentage is determined by the complexity of the organism(s) 
                        in contact with SCP-003-1; SCP-003-1 appears to devote a large amount of processing power to analysis of living organic material.</p>
                    <p>During each of SCP-003-1's growth stages, SCP-003-2 releases bursts of radiation that temporarily inhibit SCP-003-1's growth, 
                        or reverse this growth when the temperature of SCP-003-1 rises above 100°C. Similar radiation emissions have been replicated 
                        recorded via other anomalous means.</p>
                    <p>SCP-003-1's biology has been the subject of extensive study. Significant elements have been identified similar to SCP-███, 
                        SCP-1512, and SCP-2756, the latter two of which have no further confirmed connection with SCP-003-1 and no known connection 
                        with each other, and none of which are fully understood (technically, even less understood than SCP-003, thanks to the extensive 
                        cross-disciplinary research on the SCP-003 objects). To date, no convincing analysis has been put forward which satisfactorily 
                        explains SCP-003-1's connection to these SCP objects or others, nor its connection to modern technology beyond appearance 
                        (and potential mimicry via unknown mechanism).</p>

                            <p>During M03-Gloria procedures, SCP-003-1 doubled its mass and began rapid structural growth. Temperature was immediately returned 
                                to 100°C. Growth and mass increase of SCP-003-1 continued for 9 minutes and 6 seconds, at which time a sustained radiation spike 
                                was produced by SCP-003-2. In response, SCP-003-1 returned to its normal state in 3 minutes and 39 seconds. New growth dissolved 
                                into a dusty residue which was collected for analysis. Both SCP-003-1 and SCP-003-2 ceased all detectable activity. SCP-003-2 did 
                                not resume activity until connected to external power source. SCP-003-2's runes glowed uniformly gray and did not resume normal 
                                activity for three (3) hours. SCP-003-2 no longer appears to be able to maintain containment area at a temperature above 35°C without

                                SCP-003-2 once again produced a sustained radiation spike. SCP-003-1's growth stopped for 36 seconds, then resumed at its previous

                            <p>On quadrupling its mass, SCP-003-1 formed a coherent outer shell and body. After appearing to scan its environment and partially

                                were present. On physical contact with team members, SCP-003-1 encompassed them in rapidly-grown appendages and stopped growth for 
                                15 minutes. SCP-003-1 then resumed growth, and rearranged the component parts of the center of its form to the shape of a 
                                three-meter-tall female humanoid, with peripheral "tentacles" shifting to extrude primarily from SCP-003-1's newly formed "hair" 
                                and spine. SCP-003-1 then produced rudimentary vocalizations in an apparent initial attempt to communicate with researchers.

                                return the temperature to 100°C. SCP-003-1 returned to its normal state in 21 minutes and 7 seconds, and was successfully 
                                re-contained without incident.</p>
                            <p>All nine members of M03-Gloria affected by SCP-003-1 were afterwards found to be physically unharmed, with no residual effects 
                                besides psychological trauma. The converted materials of SCP-003's former containment area did not dissolve and are now under 
                                analysis.</p>
